Java-Practice
=============

Random adventures in Java.

Projects in this repository will be small and simple Java projects that are more
for practice and self enjoyment. Projects will be using new Java 8 features, such 
as streams and lambda expressions. Further Java 8 features will be implemented as 
I begin to understand them. 

All source code is available for use so long as the author (myself) is made notified
and credited. Do email me at loriondo22@gmail.com if you have any questions, comments, 
or tips on any of the source code.
